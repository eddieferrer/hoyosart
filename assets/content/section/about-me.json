  "title": "About Me",
  "body": "It seems as though I have been painting my whole life. Being creative is a \"need\" for me. I am specially drawn to the freedom of having no boundaries of representation through my art. I play with my imagination and leave the brush free to explore the canvas without worrying about the end result. Influenced by feelings and passion, my own techniques have developed.\n\nI don't look for results, I don't plan my abstractions, I just find it and give it a soul, they are analogies, simply that. I enter into a totally different world where I lose all fear, replaced with imagination and passion. The acrylic and graphite have given me strength and I have found myself.\n\n**Ana Maria Hoyos**"
